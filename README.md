# HRecPrediction

This project constructs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the number of hydrogen recombinations in photo-evaporating gas structures during the reionization of the Universe in the first billion years of cosmic history.

This is a collaboration project between Hyunbae Park and Tilman Hartwig at the University of Tokyo from 2020.

We aim to train a CNN model on existing simulation data to learn the relationship between the initial configuration of gas density structures and the number of recombinations they will undergo over the course of a photo-evaporation simulation.

Ideally, an accurate CNN model would eliminate the need for computationally expensive numerical simulations, saving significant computing time and human effort.
